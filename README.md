# Game-Mania
                                                                         
#### What's the Motive? And what is it? 
For me Games are love and Development is passion so I thought why not wear the shoes of game developer once and at the same time improve my web development skills, and this is what happened after 4 days. I made the whole website responsive so that I can play the games even when I am travelling and just used html/css/javascript to achieve the same. This project made me super confident about my fundamentals 😎
